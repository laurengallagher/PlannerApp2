This is the second part of my assignment for Mobile App 2.
I changed it slightly where in the app now it is planning out and saving the students money.
Because most students struggle with money if not on a weekly basis definitely on a monthly basis.

When i was doing this assignment i got rid of most of the errors i had but it still wouldn't run
and i couldn't figure out why.

I understand my assignment and how i done it but really struggle when i get errors.
